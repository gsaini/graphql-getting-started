# graphQL - getting started

GraphQL — A query language for APIs that was originally built by Facebook—makes it easier for you to get the data you actually need from a query. In this course, learn how to get started with GraphQL. Instructor Emmanuel Henri walks through how to set up GraphQL, explores the GraphQL schema, and goes over the basic types and fields. He also shows how to set up persistence—including how to use SQL and Mongo DB with GraphQL; covers how to add new items with mutations; and shares how to leverage some advanced features in your queries.
Topics include:
Basic GraphQL schema
Object types and fields
Role of the resolver in GraphQL
Scalar and enumeration types
Using GraphQL tools
Setting up persistence
Adding new items with mutations
Updating and deleting items with mutations
Queries with arguments, aliases, and fragments
